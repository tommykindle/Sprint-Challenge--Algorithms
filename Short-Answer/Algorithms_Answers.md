#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
 The time complexity of A would be O(n)

b)
The time complexity of B would be O(n log n)

c)
The time complexity of C would be O(n) even though there is recusion there is still only n operations

## Exercise II
